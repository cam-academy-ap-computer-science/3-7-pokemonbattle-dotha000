10 pts - Correct Output (must compile and run)
8/10 Should use the Scanner class to read input from the user instead of hardcoded the values for the following variables: lvl,atk,def,stab, and hp.
statsTable method didn't have the correct output. It should also display SP. ATK, SP. DEF, and SPEED fields too.

5 pts - Proper Use of Scanner, and decent User Interface
5/5 statsTable method, should use tab character (\t) instead spaces. See P.16, table 1.3

3 pts - Proper Use of Return
1/3 because damage and statsTable methods should all be called from main() and the damage method should have return statement instead of void.

3 pts - Proper User of Parameter
3/3

2 pts - Pseudocode and comments
